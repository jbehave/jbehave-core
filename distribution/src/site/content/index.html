<h2>What is JBehave?</h2>
<p>JBehave is a framework for <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">Behaviour-Driven
Development</a> (BDD). BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD)
and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these
practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.
It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based, and
positions itself as a design philosophy.</p>

<p>Features of JBehave include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pure Java implementation, which plays well with Java-based
	enterprises.</li>
	<li>Users can specify and run text-based user stories, which
	allows "out-in" development.</li>
	<li>Annotation-based binding of textual steps to Java methods,
	with auto-conversion of string arguments to any parameter type
	(including generic types) via custom parameter converters.</li>
	<li>Annotation-based configuration and Steps class specifications</li>
	<li>Dependency Injection support allowing both configuration and
	Steps instances composed via your favourite container (Guice,
	PicoContainer, Spring).</li>
	<li>Extensible story reporting: outputs stories executed in
	different human-readable file-based formats (HTML, TXT, XML). 
	Fully style-able view.</li>
	<li>Auto-generation of pending steps so the build is not broken by
	a missing step, but has option to configure breaking build for pending
	steps.</li>
	<li>Localisation of user stories, allowing them to be written in
	any language.</li>
	<li>IDE integration: stories can be run as JUnit tests or other
	annotation-based unit test frameworks, providing easy integration with
	your favourite IDE.</li>
	<li>Ant integration: allows stories to be run via Ant task</li>
	<li>Maven integration: allows stories to be run via Maven plugin
	at given build phase</li>
</ul>
