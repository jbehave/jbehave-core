<h2>Composite Steps</h2>

<p>BDD allows the scenario writer to vary the focus of the portion
of the system under test, or the boundary of the system for the specific
scenario. Some scenarios can be very detailed, zooming into the
step-by-step process, others can be at a higher level, zooming out to
give a bird's eye overview.</p>

<p>Allowing the composition of steps into groups whose execution can
be triggered by the matching of a single step, called <b>composite
step</b>, can be a very useful and powerful feature.</p>

<p>As usual, let's start with an example. Let's assume we've already
defined a few steps.</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java">
<![CDATA[
    @Given("<customer> has a cart")
    public void customerHasACart(@Named("customer") String customer) {
    }

    @When("a <product> is added to the cart")
    public void productIsAddedToCart(@Named("product") String product) {
    }
]]>
</script>

<p>Now we want to define a composite step that takes both parameters
(<b>customer</b> and <b>product</b>) and executes the two "composed"
steps with the parameter values provided, i.e. we want the composed
steps to be executed when the following step is matched:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
Given Mr Jones previously bought a ticket
</pre>

<p>where <b>Mr Jones</b> and <b>ticket</b> are parameter values for
<b>customer</b> and <b>product</b>.

<h3>Annotation-based definition</h3>

We can define a new method
and annotated as per usual, e.g. with the <b>@Given</b> annotation:</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java">
<![CDATA[
    @Given("$customer has previously bought a $product") // used in normal parameter matching
    @Alias("<customer> has previously bought a <product>") // used in parameterised scenarios
    @Composite(steps = { "Given <customer> is logged in", 
                         "Given <customer> has a cart", 
                         "When a <product> is added to the cart" })  
    public void compositeStep(@Named("customer") String customer, @Named("product") String product) { // composed steps use these named parameters
    }
]]>
</script>

<p>The novelty here is the introduction of the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/annotations/Composite.html">@Composite</a>
annotation. Composite steps are identified by this method-level
annotation, which is independent of the @Given/@When/@Then annotations.
The @Composite is optional and complements any of the @Given/@When/@Then
annotations. Once the composite step is matched (via any of the
supported mechanisms, e.g. <a
    href="parameter-injection.html">parameter injection</a> or <a
    href="parametrised-scenarios.html">parameterised scenarios</a>), if
the @Composite annotation is found on the matched method, the "composed"
steps defined in the @Composite annotations are created using the
parameters specified in the @Named annotations of the composite step. In
other words, the composed steps are treated as a group of parametrised
steps, much in the same way as the steps in a parametrised scenario.</p>

<p>Executing the composite step above is equivalent to executing:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
Given Mr Jones previously bought a ticket
Given Mr Jones is logged in
Given Mr Jones has a cart
When a ticket is added to the cart
</pre>

<p>Note that the composite step is executed before the composed
steps. The annotated method may of course be left to do nothing, as it's
primary scope is to provide the compostion to other steps. It is also
important to note that the composite step method needs to define named
parameters (even if it uses matched parameters), as these are then used
by the composed steps.</p>

<h3>Textual-based definition</h3>

<p>When a composite step does not require any implementation, it can be
declared in a separate textual composite file:<p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
Composite: Given $customer has previously bought a $product
Given &lt;customer&gt; is logged in
When a &lt;product&gt; is added to the cart
</pre>

<p>where</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Composite:</b> is a keyword;</li>
    <li><b>Given $customer has previously bought a $product</b> is a composite step pattern with parameters;</li>
    <li><b>Given &lt;customer&gt; is logged in</b> and <b>When a &lt;product&gt; is added to the cart</b> are
        composed steps</li>
</ul>

<p>Composite files can contain multiple definitions:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
Composite: Given composite step
Given composed step
And another composed step

Composite: Then composite step with parameter $param
Given composed step
When composed step using parameter &lt;param&gt;
Then one more composed step
</pre>

<p>Paths to composite files should be set in the configuration:</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java">
<![CDATA[
    new MostUsefulConfiguration().useCompositePaths(Collections.singletonList("composite.steps"))
]]>
</script>

<p>Also it's allowed to specify optional <a href="prioritising-steps.html">priority</a> of the composite step:<p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
Composite: Given prioritized composite step
Priority: 1
Given composed step
And another composed step
</pre>

<p>The default priority is 0</p>
