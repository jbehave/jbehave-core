<h2>A definition of BDD</h2>

<span class="followup">Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is
about implementing an application by describing it from the point of
view of its stakeholders </span>

<h2>Scenarios and Steps</h2>

<p>revolves around the concept of a <b>Scenario</b>, which
represents an <b>automatable execution of business functionality</b>. At
its core a Scenario comprises of a number of executed steps. These <b>Steps</b>
can be of three types:</p>
<pre class="brush: bdd">
Scenario:  A scenario is a collection of executable steps of different type 

A Given step represents a precondition to an event
A When step represents the occurrence of the event
A Then step represents the outcome of the event
</pre>
<p><b>Given</b>, <b>When</b> and <b>Then</b> are also called <b>BDD
Keywords</b></p>
<p>A <b>Story</b> or a <b>Feature</b>, in turn, comprises of one or
more <b>Scenario</b>s.</p>

<p>A scenario can contain any number of steps, and steps of the same
type can follow each other:</p>
<pre class="brush: bdd">
Given a wizard named Harry
Given a wizard named Hermione
When the wizards meet
Then a spark should occur
</pre>
<p>This scenario signals that there are two preconditions to the
event of the wizards meeting. As such, it may be expressed in an
equivalent way:</p>
<pre class="brush: bdd">
Given a wizard named Harry
And a wizard named Hermione
When the wizards meet
Then a spark should occur
</pre>
<p>We can then introduce another keyword:</p>
<pre class="brush: bdd">
A step starting with And assumes the same meaning of the previous step
</pre>

<h2>Communication is the key</h2>

<p>aims to provide an <b>automatable</b> description of the
behaviour of the system, from the point of view of the stakeholders. As
such, it is essential that the language used in the description reflects
the langauge used by the business users. The language and its grammar
represents the shared understanding of the behaviour between the
business users and the development team. And as any language it evolves
with the evolution of this shared understanding. BDD provides the
grammar, but the language is agreed between the business and the team.</p>
<p>The emphasys should be placed on concepts relevant to the
business, shielding away issues of technical implementation. A good rule
of thumb is that if details of the technical implementation can be
changed without affecting the overall behaviour, as visible by the
business user, then it should not appear in the scenario.</p>
