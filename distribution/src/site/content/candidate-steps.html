<h2>Candidate Steps</h2>

<p>JBehave uses <a href="annotations.html">annotations</a> in the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/CandidateSteps.html">CandidateSteps</a>
instance to associate an executable Java method to a <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/CandidateStep.html">CandidateStep</a>.
Each candidate step corresponds to one Java method and to one <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/StepType.html">StepType</a>.
A candidate step holds the regex pattern contained in the annotation
value, which is used to do the matching with the textual steps in the
scenario.</p>
<p>Let's look at a concrete example:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class TraderSteps { // It does not have to extend Steps, but it could

    private Stock stock;

    @Given("a stock of symbol $symbol and a threshold of $threshold")
    public void aStock(String symbol, double threshold) {
        stock = new Stock(symbol, threshold);
    }

    @When("the stock is traded at $price")
    @Alias("the stock is sold at $price")
    public void theStockIsTradedAt(double price) {
        stock.tradeAt(price);
    }

    @Then("the alert status should be $status")
    public void theAlertStatusShouldBe(String status) {
        ensureThat(stock.getStatus().name(), equalTo(status));
    }

}
</pre>
<p>For each method annotated with one of the <a
    href="annotations.html">step annotations</a>, a candidate step is
created. Note that each method can supports <a href="aliases.html">aliases</a>
and a different candidate step is created for each alias.</p>

<p>So, given one or more instances of Steps classes, each containing
a number of annotated methods, JBehave collects a list of candidate
steps, which are then used to match the textual steps found in the
scenarios being run. For each given <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/StepType.html">StepType</a>,
<b>the regex pattern must be unique</b>.</p>

<p>Hence, the following two methods are allowed to have the same
regex pattern, because they correspond to different step types:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">

    @Given("a stock is traded at $price")
    public void aStockWithPrice(double price) {
        // ...
    }

    @When("the stock is traded at $price")
    public void theStockIsTradedAt(double price) {
        // ...
    }
</pre>

<p>While the following would result in a runtime failure when
running the scenario:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">

    @When("a stock is traded at $price")
    public void aStockWithPrice(double price) {
        // ...
    }

    @When("the stock is traded at $price")
    public void theStockIsTradedAt(double price) {
        // ...
    }
</pre>

<p>Note that in the example above <b>TraderSteps</b> is a POJO, i.e.
it does not extend the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/Steps.html">Steps</a>
class. In this case, we need to use the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/StepsFactory.html">StepsFactory</a>
to create <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/steps/CandidateSteps.html">CandidateSteps</a>
to associate to the <b>RunnableStory</b> class. The factory creates an
instance of <b>Steps</b> which wraps the POJO instance. But, in addition
to the the composition model, JBehave also supports the inheritance
model, in which the steps class would simply extend <b>Steps</b>.  The only difference is
in how the steps are registered with the <b>RunnableStory</b>:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class TraderStory extends JUnitStory {

    public TraderStory() {
        addSteps(new TraderSteps()); // if TraderSteps extends Steps
        addSteps(new StepsFactory(configuration()).createCandidateSteps(new TraderSteps())); // if TraderSteps is a POJO
    }
}
</pre>
