<h2>From 4.x to 5.0</h2>

<p>JBehave 5.x is an evolution of 4.x.</p>

<p>From the textual stories point of view, these are completely backward compatible.</p>

<p>From the Java point of view, the most significant changes are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Changed visibility of method JUnitStories#storyPaths() from protected to public.
        Subclasses overriding the method should change visibility accordingly.</li>
    <li>Changed method names for filter exclusion from 'notAllowed' to 'excluded'.</li>
    <li>Rename Status NOT_ALLOWED to EXCLUDED.</li>
    <li>Changed default scenario type in @BeforeScenario/@AfterScenario annotations.</li>
    <li>Deprecated use of date format String parameter in OutcomesTable.  Use map parameter instead.</li>
    <li>Removed deprecated org.jbehave.core.reporters.StoryReporterBuilder.Format.
        Use org.jbehave.core.reporters.Format instead.</li>
    <li>Removed deprecated SameThreadExecutors.</li>
    <li>Removed deprecated methods in step collectors.</li>
    <li>Removed deprecated methods in StoryReporter, StepMonitor and EmbedderMonitor.</li>
    <li>JUnitStory now inherits from JUnitStories.  ConfigurableEmbedder now inherits from InjectableEmbedder.</li>
    <li>Ant tasks no longer supported.  Use JUnit support instead.</li>
    <li>Hudson/Jenkins plugins no longer supported.</li>
    <li>CrossReference and story navigator no longer supported</li>
    <li>StoryRunner no longer supported.  Use PerformableTree instead.</li>
    <li>Adding CandidateSteps via an Embedder no longer supported.
        Use InjectableStepsFactory instead.</li>
    <li>Embedder controls storyTimeoutInSecs and storyTimeoutInSecsByPath no longer supported.
        Use storyTimeouts instead.</li>
    <li>Stop reporting BeforeStories/AfterStories steps as stories. New hooks are introduced: org.jbehave.core.reporters.StoryReporter#beforeStoriesSteps and org.jbehave.core.reporters.StoryReporter#afterStoriesSteps</li>
    <li>Fix typo in StoryReporter method: lifecyle -> lifecycle</li>
    <li>Replace StoryReporter#beforeStep(String) hook with StoryReporter#beforeStep(Step)</li>
    <li>Invoke StoryReporter#beforeStep(Step) hook before all steps (including comment, pending, ignorable), previously the hook was invoked only for parameterized steps</li>
    <li> CurrencyConverter, PatternConverter, FileConverter and VerbatimConverter classes were removed, their functionality is covered by new instances of FunctionalParameterConverter class</li>
</ul>

<h2>From 3.x to 4.0</h2>

<p>JBehave 4.x is an evolution of 3.x.</p>

<p>From the textual stories point of view, these are completely backward compatible.</p>

<p>From the Java point of view, the most significant change is the
execution mechanism of the stories, with the StoryRunner
replaced by the PerformableTree. The result of execution of the
performable tree should be serialisable and consumable by any
reporting/UI layer independent of the StoryReporters.  Correspondingly, the CrossReference
class has also changed.  As customising the StoryRunner and the CrossReference is likely to
be a very niche use case, most users will  not notice any significant difference.
The rest of the configuration is backward compatible.</p>

<h2>From 3.0 to 3.1</h2>

<p>The Story Maps view has been added to the Story Reports view. As
such, the default output directory has been renamed from <b>jbehave-reports</b>
to <b>jbehave</b>. The main index view in <b>target/jbehave/view/index.html</b>
now links to both the maps and reports views (<b>view/maps.html</b> and
<b>view/reports.html</b>, respectively). Currently, it assumes that both
views are generated and there is no check on whether these views exist
or not. An upcoming enhancement will determine which views have actually
been generated and enabled the links accordingly.</p>

<p>Operationally, users should change the target view directory of
the jbehave view resources to <b>target/jbehave/view</b>. Maven users
can use the new <b>unpack-view-resources</b> goal which will derive the
view directory from the configured Embedder.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to use the latest released version <b>3.1.1</b>
of the <b>jbehave-site-resources.zip</b>, which uses a SyntaxHighlighter BDD brush
to decorate all plain-text output.</p>

<h2>From 2.x to 3.0</h2>

<p>JBehave 3.x is an evolution of 2.x, based on the experience using
it in commercial projects. With the benefit of this experience, we feel
that the overall design stood well the wear and tear, but there were
areas which called for improvements that required to break backward
compatibility.</p>

<p>From the textual stories point of view, these are almost
completely backward compatible. The only exceptions being:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>GivenScenarios</b> keyword has changed to <b>GivenStories</b>.
    Full backward compatibility can be nonetheless ensures by configuring
    the keywords bundle entry to <b>GivenScenarios</b> until the migration
    has been completed. See <a href="stories-in-your-language.html">stories
    in your language</a> on how to configure and override default keywords to
    suit your needs.</li>
    <li>Regex-based story parser now enforces that step keywords must
    be at the start of a new line. This allow keywords to be found in the
    step text and in the examples table. The convention of having keywords
    at start of line is already universally adopted and but may encounter
    the occasional failure due spurious spaces before the keywords.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the Java point of view, significant changes have occurred,
but only in the configuration of the running of the stories. The Steps
classes, which is where most users' efforts will have gone into can be
used without change in JBehave 3.</p>

<p>On the configuration side, the main changes are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Terminology has changed throughout to refer to <b>Story</b> in
    place of <b>Scenario</b> where this refers to the textual or Java
    representation reflecting the fact that scenarios in JBehave 2 were
    already stories in all but name. Terminology concerning report
    rendering has been changed to view generation.</li>
    <li>The Ant tasks and Maven goals have also been renamed to
    reflect the terminology change.</li>
    <li>The root package has changed from <b>org.jbehave.scenario</b>
    to <b>org.jbehave.core</b> to avoid classpath clashes.</li>
    <li><b>JUnitStory</b> does not extend JUnit's TestCase any more.
    To ensure the class is recognised as a JUnit test, you must make the
    source code of jbehave-core available to your IDE. Alternatively, check
    the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for other workarounds.</li>
    <li>The concerns of running stories and view generation has been
    centralised in an embeddable component - <b>Embedder</b> - around which
    there are thin wrappers for running in multiple environments, e.g.
    JUnit, Ant/Maven, Spring etc. Using the Embedder, the user can choose
    to run multiple textual story using a single Java entry point. The
    embedder behaviours can be controlled via <b>EmbedderControls</b>.</li>
    <li>JUnitStory is now a JUnit-specific extension of <b>ConfigurableEmbedder</b>
    and allows the overriding of the default MostUsefulConfiguration only
    via the <b>useConfiguration</b> method, and the specification of <b>Steps</b>
    only via the <b>addSteps</b> method. Equivalently, the user can
    override the methods <b>configuration()</b> and <b>candidateSteps()</b>.</li>
    <li>Configuration has been consolidated into a single builder and
    moved to <b>org.jbehave.core.configuration</b> package. Configuration
    and CandidateSteps are now fully specifiable via <a
        href="configuration.html">annotations</a>, with or without <a
        href="dependency-injection.html">dependency injection</a>.</li>
    <li>The textual story lookup paradigm has shifted from an <b>Embeddable</b>
    class to a story path, which can be resolved from the class via the <b>StoryPathResolver</b>,
    and its implementations <b>UnderscoredCamelCaseResolver</b> and <b>CasePreservingResolver</b>.
    As such, the <b>StoryLoader</b> implementations only define the model
    story from a story path. The <b>FilePrintStreamFactory</b>
    correspondingly now handles only story paths.</li>
</ul>
