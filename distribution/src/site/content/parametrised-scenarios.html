<h2>Examples Table</h2>

<p>Story writers often find themselves repeating scenarios, or
parts thereof, by simply changing some parameter values. These are ideal
candidates for using JBehave Table Examples feature. Let's look at the
example:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Given a stock of symbol STK1 and a threshold of 10.0
    When the stock is traded at 5.0
    Then the alert status should be OFF
    When the stock is traded at 11.0
    Then the alert status should be ON
</pre>

<p>We notice that two lines are repeated and identical but for the
values. We can then rewrite this scenario as:</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: bdd">
<![CDATA[
    Given a stock of <symbol> and a <threshold>
    When the stock is traded at <price>
    Then the alert status should be <status>
    
    Examples: 
    
    |symbol|threshold|price|status|
    |STK1|10.0|5.0|OFF|
    |STK1|10.0|11.0|ON|
]]>
</script>

<p>The <b>Examples:</b> keyword signals that the scenario should be
repeated for as many times as there are data rows in the examples table.
At each execution, the named parameters are taken from the corresponding
row.</p>
<p>One important difference to underline in using table examples is
that they require <a href="parameter-injection.html">named
parameters</a> for the step candidates to be matched to Java methods. The
named parameters allow the parameters to be injected using the table row
values with the corresponding header name, instead of being extracted
from the annotation pattern match. As such, <b>the step annotation pattern
must hold the verbatim textual step</b>. e.g.:</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java">
<![CDATA[
    @Given("a stock of <symbol> and a <threshold>")
    public void aStock(@Named("symbol") String symbol, @Named("threshold") double threshold) {
        // ...
    }
]]>
</script>

<p>Also note that while the characters delimiting the parameter names in the regex pattern are
purely conventional - they only serve the purpose of matching the step method in a readable manner - 
the use of the angle brackets is required as it is used to replace the name with the value in the reporting.
</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the same (<code>@Named</code>-annotated) methods can match steps 
that are executed both as standalone or via examples table, provided that both regex patterns are configured,
one as the main pattern and one as an alias:</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java">
<![CDATA[
    @Given("a stock of symbol $symbol and a threshold of $threshold") // standalone
    @Alias("a stock of <symbol> and a <threshold>") // examples table
    public void aStock(@Named("symbol") String symbol, @Named("threshold") double threshold) {
        // ...
    }
]]>
</script>

<p>Moreover, the examples table alias can happily co-exists with other standalone aliases:</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java">
<![CDATA[
    @Given("a stock of symbol $symbol and a threshold of $threshold") // standalone
    @Aliases(values={"a stock with a symbol of $symbol and a threshold of $threshold", // a standalone alias
                     "a stock of <symbol> and a <threshold>"}) // an examples table alias
    public void aStock(@Named("symbol") String symbol, @Named("threshold") double threshold) {
        // ...
    }
]]>
</script>
